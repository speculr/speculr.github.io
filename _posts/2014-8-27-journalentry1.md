## putting on a show
There is such a thing as a portfolio show where design people will showcase the work they have done the past few years to friends, family, and prospective employers. This is all new to me but supposedly it is a very big deal.

Things to be done on my end include redoing almost all of the projects I have done so far. None of them I feel are up to par. So a good deal of my time will be dedicated to this. This is no joke.

The other task will be working with the cpcc students to create a great show. We began by dividing into groups to share responsibilities. In addition to fundraising and promotional work I will be part of the logistics team. Other teams include finances, marketing, project management, and venue. The way this thing is organized is already giving me a slightly negative premonition of how this is going to go for the next few months.

I will try to keep my head down and remain optimistic. There is so much of my own work to focus on anyway. And it looks like the best way I can contribute is by supporting the team. There are plenty of unabashedly opportunistic people out there with very strong opinions. The emotionally intelligent thing to do is try to accomodate them without compromising too much of yourself.
